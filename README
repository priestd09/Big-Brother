What Big-Brother should do:

1) Set a random school in your profile
1) Add random people from "your school".
Some of them accept request and are now your friends.
2) Add the friends of your new friends and now the ones you add will see that you have mutual friend(s), 
therefore are more likely to accept your friend request.
3) If friend request accepted, get all information (emails, location, interest, family members etc.) and...
4) push to SQL database. (MySQL or PostgreSQL?)

*Use proxies
*Switch accounts because more accounts = more info and we have to have delays anyway
We can harvest while other accounts are waiting, but multiple accounts of a later stage, I guess.
*Use delay when adding (think days when adding lots of people)

We should also publish our data in an interesting way (graphs and shit) and have some sort of standard, to show "with this information, we could do some nasty things".
