Goal: harvest and analyse as much information on people from Facebook as possible.

How will we achieve this goal?
 Short term:
  - Use proxies (TOR + Privoxy)
  - Use delays to evade blocking
 Medium term:
  - Create multiple accounts and switch between them, so that we can harvest even while other accounts are "waiting" (later stage)
 Long term:
  - Publish our data in an interesting way (include graphs, for example)
  - Compare our data with a evil-standard (the amount of/which information we need to potentially cause evil)
  - Analyse efficiency (percentage of people accepting friend requests, percentage of people publicly displaying date of birth)
  - Combine with other social media sites (Twitter)

General program flow:
1. Set a random school in the profile.
2. Add random people from the school. Some will become your friends.
3. Add the friends of the newly made friends. These will see that they have mutual friend(s) and are therefore more likely to accept the friend request.
4. Harvest information from the profiles from friends (step 1-3 are required) and publicly visible profiles (no prerequisites)
5. Store the information in a SQL database.
